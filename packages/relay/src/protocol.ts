/**
 * Current relay protocol version the client advertises on register.
 *
 * **v2** added the `fs` execution class (`executionClass:"fs"`)
 * so the server can proxy discrete filesystem primitives to the relay
 * for the unified `file` tool's `current`/`absolute` zones. A v2 relay
 * is the prerequisite for routing `file` fs ops to a connected machine.
 *
 * **v3** added MCP hosting messages:
 * `relay:configure-mcp` (server→relay) and `relay:advertise-mcp-tools`
 * (relay→server), plus the optional `RelayCapabilities.mcpTools`
 * summary advertised at register. A v3 relay is the prerequisite for
 * the server routing MCP tool calls through a connected machine.
 * Backward-compatible — v2 relays still register and operate.
 *
 * **v4** added the `local-file` execution class and
 * typed `RelayLocalFileRequest`/`RelayLocalFileResult` wire contract,
 * plus optional `RelayCapabilities.localFileExecution` and
 * `canRunOffice` advertisements. A v4 Electron desktop relay is the
 * prerequisite for local-zone file execution; v1–v3 relays still
 * register and operate without local-file dispatch.
 *
 * **v5** adds bounded media chunk transport. It never places an
 * entire media file in one WebSocket message: each chunk is canonical base64
 * for at most 1 MiB decoded, while a transfer is capped at 64 MiB.
 *
 * **v6** added the historical grant-envelope foundation.
 * The strict renamed `desktopFilesystemGrant*` request/snapshot fields are
 * v9-only; pre-v9 relays never receive or retain those fields.
 *
 * **v7** adds desktop-session identity and an atomic
 * capability-replacement transport. The Electron desktop relay registers
 * with a per-main-process-launch `desktopSessionId` and a monotonic
 * `capabilityRevision`, and may later send `relay:update-capabilities`
 * (client→server) to atomically replace its full advertised capability
 * state — without a reconnect. The renamed advisory grant snapshot is gated
 * separately at protocol v9.
 * The server acknowledges with `relay:capabilities-updated`. Headless
 * relays omit `desktopSessionId` and never send the update; they continue
 * to register and operate as before. Backward-compatible — v1–v6 relays
 * still register and operate.
 *
 * **v8** adds a separate optional Electron Codex host transport.
 * Codex work is never represented as `relay:dispatch`.
 *
 * **v9** renames generic local filesystem grant request and
 * snapshot wire fields to `desktopFilesystemGrant*`, plus one strict,
 * high-level `local-file` `apply_patch` operation. The renamed strict fields
 * are not aliases, so the capability protocol version is bumped. Its
 * payload is patch text plus trusted routing metadata;
 * it never carries argv, shell text, environment values, or a server
 * Workspace storage path. A v9-capable desktop relay must still revalidate
 * live local Desktop filesystem authority before any future execution.
 *
 * **v10** establishes bounded `fs.readdir` as a
 * protocol contract. The relay caps every listing at
 * `RELAY_FS_READDIR_MAX_ENTRIES`, reads only through the sentinel entry, and
 * returns `truncated` when there were more entries.
 * **v11** adds a narrow `relay:run-shell-progress` envelope.
 * It is emitted only for paired Desktop raw-shell output; it is not a
 * general tool streaming facility. Final `relay:result` remains canonical.
 *
 * **v12** adds the correlated local-MCP truth channel:
 * `relay:mcp-preflight` / result and an optional operation envelope on the
 * existing `relay:configure-mcp` / result. A v12 peer is required because
 * the server must never mistake a v11 relay's old fire-and-forget configure
 * behavior for a confirmed process outcome. The existing uncorrelated
 * configure frame remains valid for v3–v11 compatibility.
 *
 * **v13** adds a separate Electron ACP readiness-only channel. It
 * carries no executable, path, environment, raw probe output, credentials,
 * ACP traffic, or task execution command.
 *
 * **v14** adds a typed prepared-workspace execution lane and
 * bounded semantic events. It still excludes raw ACP, local paths,
 * executable/environment data, provider/model controls, permission response,
 * and Stop.
 *
 * **v14 (destination union)** changes the structured-SSH approved
 * request and prepare envelopes to reject stale host-only intent. It carries
 * either a named connection or an exact ad hoc endpoint, never both.
 *
 * **v15** adds a narrow `relay:structured-ssh-progress`
 * envelope. It carries bounded process output observations or copy-transfer
 * counters for one already-dispatched structured SSH operation. It is not a
 * generic stream, cannot authorize, retry, or complete an operation, and the
 * final `relay:result` remains canonical.
 *
 * It also adds optional `canContinueBrowserPageRead` and
 * `canSearchResearchWeb` capabilities and
 * installs an Electron-local owner binding for immutable browser-page
 * snapshots. The reference is never server authority and old relays retain
 * ordinary bounded page reads.
 *
 * **v13** adds the separately negotiated
 * `canInspectBrowserPageSnapshot` capability. A v12 peer may retain and page
 * a non-EOF snapshot, but must never receive an EOF page reference or
 * eviction receipt.
 *
 * **v17** adds a closed, correlated Claude Connections discovery
 * transport. It carries no task, session, credential, path, or cost data.
 *
 * **v18** adds a distinct current-socket Claude execution transport.
 * It is only an Electron host forwarding seam; discovery remains v17.
 *
 * **v19** binds hosted-MCP dispatch to the exact owning Relay. The
 * generic `hostedBy` provenance marker prevents a runtime-advertised MCP name
 * from shadowing a built-in dispatch lane.

// the dispatch maps to the active profile/session grant authority.
//

// capability revision, active profile binding, expected subject, and the live
// local grant store) and may use profile-bound roots only after that
// revalidation succeeds. A stale, revoked, foreign, or mismatched
// relay/profile/session reference fails closed with a stable denial. The
// server's `allowedRoots` / `sandboxProfile` are never authority for the
// binding; they remain the sandbox envelope, unchanged.

// a structured `git` operation. The structured variant is the only seam
// through which the typed GitBroker is reached; a raw `command: "git ..."` is
// NEVER parsed or allowlisted into the broker — it stays on the ordinary
// sandboxed shell path and receives no metadata/template exception.
//
// This parser is the strict ingress gate the desktop relay calls before
// constructing a `GitBroker`. It admits ONLY the six bounded operations the
// broker owns, with explicit `paths` / `message` / `ref` / `target` fields per
// operation. Anything else — extra keys, wrong types, pathspec magic, a
// missing required field — fails closed with a stable error. The agent-side
// Zod schema mirrors this shape for the model; the relay re-validates because
// the wire is untrusted.
